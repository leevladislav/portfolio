        I really like my job, because it gives me some tools
        for self-expression, transforming the simple code
        into great and interesting web-sites.
        Every project I provide has highest quality,
        fully responsive, and tested in the wide range
        of devices. I like to work and create some simple,
        beautiful and intuitive interfaces in a team.
        You can see that in every screen.

        I also took a part with my friends in creating
        a free website project for volunteers and
        veterinary clinic in Kryvyi Rih. That was very
        perfect experience with too friendly people.
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the gym or
        reading a book.
